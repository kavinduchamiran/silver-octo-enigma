A repo to keep the various resources and materials I used in my job-finding journey. 

As Bimsara said, "May my efforts be of use to you! As many other's have become for me!"

## Getting your CV right

If you ask 10 people about how to create a CV, they would have 11 opinions. It really boils down to the following points.
1. The CV should be as simple as possible. When it comes to a software engineer's CV, less is always more. 
	* Avoid using Canva or Photoshop. Either LaTeX or Word. That's it. 
	* A4 page size with 0.5 border. 
	* White background, Black color text. 
	* Simple Serif of Sans Serif font. 
	* 11pt or 12pt font size for body. Your name can be 20pt in bold.
	* You must be consistent with the styling throughout the document.
	* All paragraphs should be justified. 
	* Bullet points could be aligned over the left border (0.5 from left). 
	* Add clickable links to your LinkedIn (must), Email (must), Portfolio, Blog, StackOverflow, GitHub, etc. Anything that can speak for your skills and your achievements. Pick the best 2.
	* Add your location as well. Something short like Colombo, LK.
	* Optionally, you can hyperlink your employer names to their websites.

2. Recruiters don't read CVs. They just glance over, for about 10 seconds. So all the vital information that interests the recruiter should easily be visible and findable on your CV.

3. Whether the CV could be 2 pages or not depends on the demography. The rule of thumb is anyone with less than 10 years of experience can sum everything up to a single page. But as long as you have all the vital information on the first page, and anything else that could help your case on the second page, 2 pages are fine as well. 2 pages is the absolute max. It is about prioritizing the importance of the information you are trying to convey.

4. The other debate is whether the CV should be a single column or 2 columns. If you are applying online, you are better safe sticking to a single column. Sending the CV through a referral is a different story. You can be creative and do a nicely structured 2 column CV. As to the "why". See ATS.

5. Usually I don't add a photo unless it was asked in the job description. Some descriptions will explicitly ask you to avoid attaching a photo. Even when you do, it should be a professional, clear photo of your face (just you, definitely not a family photo), and the background should be simple, clear, and not busy. I have a light plain color as the background.

6.  What to include in your CV?
	1. **Professional Summary:** 
		* A 3-4 lines long statement summarizing your CV. 
		* It should highlight your experience and the key skills that you can transfer to the employer. 
		* You can end it by saying why you are interested in the specific employer/company. 
		* Something native to them to show that you are genuinely interested.

	2. **Skills Profile:**
		* A set of skills that you can transfer to the next employer.
		* Both technical and non-technical skills.
		* Avoid having percentages or the number of years of experience you have with a programming language. When you say you are 90% confident in Java, what does that mean exactly? What does the missing 10% include? Or when you say you worked with Java for 4 years, does that mean you used Java for 4 consecutive years? Or was it from time to time? None of this makes sense. You can optionally mention a couple of other languages that you know, just to demonstrate that you are adaptable. You may, however, use English words like "expert", "proficient", and "prior experience" to describe your experience level in each language (from the CTCI book) but I don't do that. If you know it, you know it.
		* Copy and paste any specific tools or software from the JD, as they are. Whatever you put in your CV, you must be able to answer any questions if they ever ask you in an interview.
		* You might be able to extract some soft skills from the JD. Better if you have a bullet point in the "work experiences" section to prove a specific skill. For example, you can list "team leadership" as a soft skill and you second that in a bullet point talking about how you led a team to achieve something that meant a great deal to your employer.

	3. **Work Experience:** 
		* Your professional career, but in reverse chronological order. Most recent positions first. 
		* If you were promoted/held several positions in the same company, you can add the company as the main title, and your positions as subtitles. Mention the start month/year and end month/year for each company/position.
		* In each position, talk about your achievements (NOT job responsibilities) in bullet points. 
		* A single line is better, but if you go for 2 lines, make sure to fill it to the end.
		* 5 bullets for your current position, 3-4 for your past positions.
		* Add quantifiable results if only it makes sense. You can use the SAR format. I will add a link below.
		* Try to use the wording/language from the job description as much as possible. Think of the JD requirements are questions in an exam, and your bullet points are highly specific answers to those questions. You are essentially giving the recruiter reasons to see you as someone who can resolve the set of problems they are trying to resolve by hiring someone for that position.
		* Some people have a separate "Projects" section but since I don't have much space on my CV, what I do is integrate project information into these bullet points.
		* You can also talk about your career highlights (awards, special projects, customers you dealt with), if it makes sense for the position.

	4. **Certifications:**
		* Any popular certifications you have under your belt.
		* Your දහම් පාසල් certificates don't count. Neither are the ones from Udemy or Coursera.
		* Only well-known and official certificates.
		* AWS, Kubernetes, Oracle, etc.

	5. **Education:**
		* If you have an MSc, that first.
		* If not, mention your bachelor's degree.
		* University name, country, graduation date (if within the past 10 years).
		* You can additionally mention your IELTS results.
		* High school is not important.

	6. **Extracurricular activities, and voluntary work**, if the space permits. Only to show that you play hard as much as you work hard.

	7. **References:** This again depends on your target country. Some employers ask for references. Some implicitly assume you can provide references if need be.

7. You MUST tailor your CV (and cover letter), for every job description. Don't just send the same CV to 500 companies and blindly hope that one of them will respond.
	* Use the language from the JD.
	* Use the same terms as the JD. If the JD says J2EE and your CV says Jakarta EE, that's not a match.
	* Try to match your experience bullet points to the job requirements as much as possible.
	* Don't ask ChatGPT to rewrite your CV. Many employers have systems in place to detect AI-generated content and you risk getting banned from applying for that employer, ever. Instead, you can ask it to highlight the keywords from the JD or to highlight what you can emphasize from your list of experiences to best match the JD requirements. Use that as a language helper tool but never a CV writer.
	* Your CV should paint you as an "achiever" more than a "doer". Use active voice. Simple sentences. Avoid technical jargon. Note that the first human reader of your CV can very well be a non-technical person.
	* Avoid generic words. Use some unique words to bring an element of originality to your CV.

8. Finally, make sure there are no grammar mistakes or bad spellings on your CV. This is a big red flag and exhibits your clumsiness. For this, you can use Grammarly, ChatGPT, Word's spell checker, or anything that works for you.

### ATS

Applicant Tracking Systems, also known as ATS, are a kind of software recruiters use to filter out the most matching CVs out of the 1000s of CVs they get for a single position. ATSes read your CV, from left to right, from top to bottom (like a human), and extract your key information (name, location, email, linkedin, work experiences, etc). It uses this information to rank your CV. So when the recruiter asks the ATS to show the top 10 candidate CVs, yours must be good and matching enough to be in that filtered list.

An ATS is basically a search engine and it uses the text in your CV, and text from the JD, and outputs a match score. When your CV does not match well with the JD, it does not mean that the ATS will not pick it up. It just means that it won't be in the top 10.

The first time a real human reads (scans through) your CV is after the ATS filters out the bad CVs. Then the lucky few will be shortlisted and asked for an interview.

This is why I prefer a single-column resume if I'm applying online because there is a good chance that there sits an ATS between my CV and the human hiring manager. 2 column resumes tend to screw up the ATS when it reads from left to right. Some say modern ATSes can detect the column break but why take the risk? Even if the modern ones can, who is not to say that the company is still using their crappy old ATS system? It is also the reason why you need to tailor your CV to the JD and have keywords in the CV so that the ATS would rank yours higher.

Your CV still needs to look pleasant and easy to read because, at some point, an actual human will read it. So even if you managed to get past the ATS, if the human is not happy with your CV, you lose your chance.

I will include some links I collected over the course. I recommend you read them if you have time.

## Books to improve your knowledge

Some books I read to improve my DSA skills, to get some idea about how large scale systems work, and to learn the best practices that make a code great. You can expect a coding interview that involves data structures, algorithms, and system design, in almost all the companies.

They would rarely ask you to explain OOP concepts, if you have been in the industry for few years. Now what they are looking for is how good of a solution you can provide using whichever the concepts you have learned at your college or previous employer, in a real world application.

It is best if you get the solution right. It is still okay if your solution was average, as long as you can reason about it. For any answer you come up with, you better be able to back it up with some valid facts.

 1. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
 2. Clean Architecture: A CRAFTSMAN’S GUIDE TO SOFTWARE STRUCTURE AND DESIGN
 3. Competitive Programmer’s Handbook
 4. Cracking the Coding Interview
 5. Designing Data-intensive Applications
 6. Guide to Competitive Programming
 7. Head First Design Patterns
 8. Introduction to Algorithms

## Job search sites

Here are some sites I used to look for jobs.

1. LinkedIn Jobs
2. Seek.com, Seek.com.au, Seek.co.az
3. Relocate.me
4. GlassDoor jobs
5. Indeed.com

Also this list contains several AU companies that sponsor your visa.

### Grow your network

Whichever website you use, you have a far better chance getting an interview if you could get your CV referred through someone already working in that company.

This person can be someone from your previous company, your alma mater, your relative or a complete stranger. Establish a professional relationship with the person first and then ask if they would refer your CV. Or they can tell you some tips to optimize your CV for that company. They can tell you about the company culture and interview style. They can even help you to find accommodation when you finally move there. 

Having a good network is like having a great army behind you.
